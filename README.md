# github-java-enums

Your task is to model GitHub to the following specification. Look for opportunities to use Enums.

# MVP

### GitHubAccount

Has these properties:

username  
name  
repositories  
accountType (free, pro)

- GitHubAccounts contain a collection of repositories that can be added to
- `repositories` could be a `HashMap<String, Repository>` where the key is the repo name and the value is a `Repository` object. If this is not clear you could use an ArrayList.
- GitHubAccounts always start free, but we should be able to upgrade / downgrade
- We should have the ability to add repositories
- We should be able to get a repository by name
- We should be able to get the repository with the most commits

### Repository

Has these properties:

name  
description  
repositoryType (private, public)  
commits  

- A Repository has collection of commits
- `commits` could be an `ArrayList`
- We should be able to get a commit by its uniqueId
- We should be able to get all commits of a certain type (e.g. all features)

### Commit

Has these properties:

description  
commitType (feature, bugfix, refactor, other)  
uniqueId  

- In the real world `uniqueId` would be generated by git. For the moment just choose your own when you new-up a Commmit.
 
 
# Extensions

- A Repository should be able to revert (roll-back) commits to a certain point. A test might look something like this -

```
Arrange: [commit1, commit2, commit3]
Act: repo.revert(commit2uniqueId)
Assert: Expected = [commit1, commit2]
```
- Create a `GitHub` class with has a collection of GitHubAccount
- We should be able to get an alphabetically sorted list of GitHubAccount
